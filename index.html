              Bryant has made great progress creating a system of player movement. It allows the player to move in the four cardinal dirctions and features a fixed camera. Our team decided that houses will have distinct floors to differentiate them from the outside once the walls and ceiling has faded away. Daniel has made a really nice house with two porches! He has also been working on modeling a clock tower based off of some real life photos for extra realism. Eric has made sample 3-D character models for the the ghost along with a brand new logo to represent our product. Halvor created a rudimentary environment to walk around and blocks representing houses the ghost player can float through. He also worked on setting up this blog until the time comes to integrate Bryant's movement system and Daniel and Eric's models into the basic environment we have started with.

              Poltergames Blog Week 8
            </h2>
            <h3 class="post-subtitle">
             So during this week I (Eric) used my modular model for the character models to make the Inspector and an enemy. I used multiple parts from the inspector model when making the enemy to decrease the time of model making. I also worked on making my own textures that can be repeatable when applied to a model. Daniel worked on learning ZBrush as some additional modeling software. He also made it so that the models for the houses have more personality by shrinking some of the vertices. Bryant worked on the battle system. In the beginning of the code he worked on having the characters fighting spawn into the gameworld on opposite sides. He will continue working on the battle system with things such as player controlled actions, turn order and enemy AI. Halvor has been working on triggering events. This goes along the line of people entering houses and the houses disappearing like we planned in the original design of the game. He also worked on having a combat scene trigger. This involves walking into a character and the scene activating going to Bryants battle system he made.
